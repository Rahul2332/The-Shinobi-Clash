**THE SHINOBI CLASH**

This is an action game made using HTML, JavaScript Canvas.

It includes variety of predefined moves that user can chose to attack on the opponent, the opponent's attacks are moves chosen from the set of predefined attacks at random. A health status bar is shown at the top of the window for both user and the opponent, whoever lasts the longest, wins.

Images were cropped and edited from sprite sheets and were used to create animations. This game was developed in a two-day hackathon by me and my teammate Mayank.
